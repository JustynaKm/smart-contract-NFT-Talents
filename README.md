## Introduction

This repository documents the process of deploying a smart contract using two popular tools in the Ethereum ecosystem: Remix - Ethereum IDE and the OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard.

The smart contract, named `JustynaSToken`, is an ERC20 (or ERC721) token that implements a time-based lock mechanism.

## Getting Started

To get started, ensure you have the following:

- A GitHub account
- Solidity programming knowledge
- An Ethereum wallet for deploying and interacting with the smart contract
- Access to Remix - Ethereum IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- Access to the OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard)

## Deployment Steps

### Using Remix

1. Open Remix in your web browser: https://remix.ethereum.org/
2. Load your `JustynaSToken.sol` contract code.
3. Select the correct Solidity compiler version.
4. Deploy the contract to the desired Ethereum network using the Remix deployment feature.
5. Note down the transaction hash and contract address.

### Using OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard

1. Visit the OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard documentation: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard
2. Follow the guide to create and customize your smart contract using the wizard.
3. Once the contract code is generated, compile it using your preferred development environment.
4. Deploy the compiled contract using Remix, Hardhat, or your preferred deployment tool.
5. Verify and test the deployed contract.

## Verifying the Deployment

After deploying the contract, you can verify and test it using tools like Etherscan or a custom testing suite. To verify the contract on Etherscan, follow their verification process and provide the contract's source code and necessary details.
